Journal of personality and social psychology 73, 733–46 (11 1997). https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.733](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9325591/).

## facial_features

The `facial_features` folder contains 72 folders, one for each participant. Each participant folder `PP###` contains 6 CSV files, one for each game. The files follow the naming convention `facialfeatures_[id]_g[g#].csv`, where:
- `[id]`: Participant ID
- `[g#]`: Game number; either `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`.

These CSVs contain the output for each frame after running the image through [OpenFace 2.0](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Output-Format).

The columns in these CSVs are:
- `id`: Participant ID
- `game file`: `g[g#]` from file name
- `frame`: Game frame number
- columns from OpenFace analysis, as described in the [OpenFace 2.0 wiki](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Output-Format).

## game_frames
Due to its large size, the `game_frames` data is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S599DvrA6L-ekYulOChAOBCszQfpUJ3l?usp=sharing)

The `game_frames` folder should be placed in the [react/react-nao/data](/react-nao/data) folder.

The `game_frames` folder contains 72 folders, one for each participant. Each participant folder `PP###` contains 6 json files, one for each game. The files follow the naming convention `gameframes_[id]_g[g#].json`, where:
- `[id]`: Participant ID
- `[g#]`: Game number; either `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, or `6`.

The json file loads as a dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are string representations of the `frame_number`. The data is another dictionary with `frame` and `action` information.
- `frame`: The `frame` dictionary has information about the game state at this specific frame of the game.

    |`player_avg_frequency`|Average|Float|
    |`frame_sent`|Was frame successfully sent over websocket|Boolean|
    |`player_action`|Action participant ship took in frame (move left, move right, or shoot) |Dictionary: {`left`: Boolean, `right`: Boolean, `shoot`: Boolean, `tried_to_shoot`: Boolean}|
    |`ai_actual_action`|Action that ai ship took in frame, considering all constraints |Dictionary: {`left`: Boolean, `right`: Boolean, `shoot`: Boolean}|
    |`ai_received_action`|Action for ai spaceship received from ai's current policy |Dictionary: {`left`: Boolean, `right`: Boolean, `shoot`: Boolean}|
    |`signal_down` & `signal_up`|Did participant provide negative (down) or positive (up) feedback via keyboard presses |Boolean|
    |`tried_signal_down` & `tried_signal_up`|Did participant try to give negative (down) or positive (up) feedback via keyboard presses, but was within buffer |Boolean|



- `action`: The `action` dictionary has information about the action that the robot spaceship's should take based on its current policy.
    |Key|Description |Values |
    |---|---|---|
    |`left`| Did the robot's spaceship policy decide the spaceship should move left? |True / False|
    | `right`| Did the robot's spaceship policy decide the spaceship should move right?|True / False|
    | `shoot`| Did the robot's spaceship policy decide the spaceship should shoot upwards? |True / False|
